# Docker Orchestration

In this lab you will play around with the container orchestration features of Docker. You will deploy a simple application to a single host and learn how that works. Then, you will configure Docker Swarm Mode, and learn to deploy the same simple application across multiple hosts. You will then see how to scale the application and move the workload across different hosts easily.

## Document conventions

When you encounter a phrase in between `<` and `>`  you are meant to substitute in a different value. 

For instance if you see `ssh docker@<node1-ip>` you would actually type something like `ssh docker@10.0.0.1`

You will be asked to SSH into various nodes. These nodes are referred to as **node1**, **node2**, **node3**, etc. The IP address for each of these nodes is on the card you received.

## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

This lab requires three Linux nodes with Docker 17.03 (or higher) installed.

Also, please make sure you can SSH into the Linux nodes. If you haven't already done so, please SSH in to **node1**, **node2**, and **node3**.

You can do that by SSHing into **node1**.

```
$ ssh docker@<node1-IP address>
```

Then, **node2**.

```
$ ssh docker@<node2 IP address>
```

And, finally **node3**.

```
$ ssh docker@<node3 IP address>
```

# <a name="basics"></a>Section 1: What is Orchestration

So, what is Orchestration anyways? Well, Orchestration is probably best described using an example. Lets say that you have an application that has high traffic along with high-availability requirements. Due to these requirements, you typically want to deploy across at least 3+ machines, so that in the event a host fails, your application will still be accessible from at least two others. Obviously, this is just an example and your use-case will likely have its own requirements, but you get the idea.

Deploying your application without Orchestration is typically very time consuming and error prone, because you would have to manually SSH into each machine, start up your application, and then continually keep tabs on things to make sure it is running as you expect.

But, with Orchestration tooling, you can typically off-load much of this manual work and let automation do the heavy lifting. One cool feature of Orchestration with Docker Swarm, is that you can deploy an application across many hosts with only a single command (once Swarm mode is enabled). Plus, if one of the supporting nodes dies in your Docker Swarm, other nodes will automatically pick up load, and your application will continue to hum along as usual.

If you are typically only using `docker run` to deploy your applications, then you could likely really benefit from using Docker Compose, Docker Swarm mode, and both Docker Compose and Swarm.

# <a name="start-cluster"></a>Section 2: Configure Swarm Mode

Real-world applications are typically deployed across multiple hosts as discussed earlier. This improves application performance and availability, as well as allowing individual application components to scale independently. Docker has powerful native tools to help you do this.

An example of running things manually and on a single host would be to create a new container on **node1** by running `docker run -dt ubuntu sleep infinity`.

```
$ docker run -dt ubuntu sleep infinity
Unable to find image 'ubuntu:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/ubuntu

```

This command will create a new container based on the `ubuntu:latest` image and will run the pets command to keep the container running in the background. You can verify our example container is up by running `docker ps` on **node1**.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
044bea1c2277        ubuntu              "sleep infinity"    2 seconds ago       Up 1 second                             distracted_mayer
```

But, this is only on a single node. What happens if this node goes down? Well, our application just dies and it is never restarted. To restore service, we would have to manually log into this machine, and start tweaking things to get it back up and running. So, it would be helpful if we had some type of system that would allow us to run this "sleep" application/service across many machines. 

In this section you will configure *Swarm Mode*. This is an optional mode in which multiple Docker hosts form into a self-orchestrating group of daemons/services called a *swarm*. Swarm mode enables new features such as *services* and *bundles* that help you deploy and manage multi-container apps across multiple Docker hosts.

You will complete the following:

- Configure *Swarm mode*
- Run the app
- Scale the app
- Drain nodes for maintenance and reschedule containers

A swarm comprises one or more *Manager Nodes* and  one or more *Worker Nodes* (technically you don't have to have *Worker Nodes*, you could run a swarm of one manager). The manager nodes maintain the state of swarm and schedule application containers. The worker nodes run the application containers. As of Docker 1.12, no external backend, or 3rd party components, are required for a fully functioning swarm - everything is built-in!

In this part of the demo you will use all three of the nodes in your lab. __node1__ will be the Swarm manager, while __node2__ and __node3__ will be worker nodes. Swarm mode supports a highly available redundant manager nodes, but for the purposes of this lab you will only deploy a single manager node.

## Step 2.1 - Create a Manager node

If you haven't already done so, please SSH in to **node1**.

```
$ ssh docker@<node1 IP address>
```

In this step you'll initialize a new Swarm, join a single worker node, and verify the operations worked.

Run `docker swarm init` on **node1**.

```
$ docker swarm init
Swarm initialized: current node (6dlewb50pj2y66q4zi3egnwbi) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-1wxyoueqgpcrc4xk2t3ec7n1poy75g4kowmwz64p7ulqx611ih-68pazn0mj8p4p4lnuf4ctp8xy \
    10.0.0.5:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

You can run the `docker info` command to verify that **node1** was successfully configured as a swarm manager node.

```
$ docker info

<Snip>
```

The swarm is now initialized with **node1** as the only Manager node. In the next section you will add **node2** and **node3** as *Worker nodes*.

##  Step 2.2 - Join Worker nodes to the Swarm

You will perform the following procedure on **node2** and **node3**. Towards the end of the procedure you will switch back to **node1**.

Open a new SSH session to __node2__ (Keep your SSH session to **node1** open in another tab or window).

```
$ ssh docker@<node2 IP address>
```

Now, take that entire `docker swarm join ...` command we copied earlier from `node1` where it was displayed as terminal output. We need to paste the copied command into the terminal of **node2** and **node3**.

It should look something like this for **node2**. By the way, if the `docker swarm join ...` command scrolled off your screen already, you can run the `docker swarm join-token worker` command on the Manager node to get it again.

```
$ docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-1wxyoueqgpcrc4xk2t3ec7n1poy75g4kowmwz64p7ulqx611ih-68pazn0mj8p4p4lnuf4ctp8xy \
    10.0.0.5:2377
```

Again, ssh into **node3** and it should look something like this.

```
$ ssh docker@<node3 IP address>
```

```
$ docker swarm join \
    --token SWMTKN-1-1wxyoueqgpcrc4xk2t3ec7n1poy75g4kowmwz64p7ulqx611ih-68pazn0mj8p4p4lnuf4ctp8xy \
    10.0.0.5:2377
```

Once you have run this on **node2** and **node3**, switch back to **node1**, and run a `docker node ls` to verify that both nodes are part of the Swarm. You should see three nodes, **node1** as the Manager node and **node2** and **node3** both as Worker nodes.

```
$ docker node ls
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
6dlewb50pj2y66q4zi3egnwbi *  node1   Ready   Active        Leader
ym6sdzrcm08s6ohqmjx9mk3dv    node3   Ready   Active
yu3hbegvwsdpy9esh9t2lr431    node2   Ready   Active
```

The `docker node ls` command shows you all of the nodes that are in the swarm as well as their roles in the swarm. The `*` identifies the node that you are issuing the command from.

Congratulations! You have configured a swarm with one manager node and two worker nodes.

# <a name="multi-application"></a>Section 3: Deploy applications across multiple hosts

Now that you have a swarm up and running, it is time to deploy our really simple sleep application.

You will perform the following procedure from **node1**.

Our pets application is becoming very popular on the internet (due to hitting Reddit and HN). People just love it. So, you are going to have to scale your application to meet peak demand. You will have to do this across multiple hosts for high availability too. We will use the concept of *Services* to scale our application easily and manage many containers as a single entity.

> *Services* are a new concept in Docker 1.12. They work with swarms and are intended for long-running containers.

You will perform this procedure from **node1**.

Lets deploy a simple web app as a *Service* across our Docker Swarm.

```
$ docker service create --name pets -p 5000:5000  chrch/docker-pets:1.0
of5rxsxsmm3asx53dqcq0o29c
```

Verify that the `service create` has been received by the Swarm manager.

```
$ docker service ls
ID            NAME       MODE        REPLICAS  IMAGE
of5rxsxsmm3a  pets       replicated  1/1       ubuntu:latest
```

The state of the service may change a couple times until it is running. The image is being downloaded from Docker Hub to the other daemons/services in the Swarm. Once the image is downloaded the container goes into a running state on one of the three nodes.

Go ahead and check out the web page by visiting `http://<node1 IP address>:5000/`

Well done. You have deployed the pets app to your new Swarm using Docker services. 

# <a name="scale-application"></a>Section 4 - Scale the application up and down

Demand is crazy! Everybody loves your pets app! It's time to scale out.

One of the great things about *services* is that you can scale them up and down to meet demand. In this step you'll scale the service up and then back down.

You will perform the following procedure from **node1**.

Scale the number of containers in the `pets` service to 6 with the `docker service update --replicas 6 pets` command. `replicas` is the term we use to describe identical containers providing the same service.

```
$ docker service update --replicas 6 pets
```
	
The Swarm manager schedules so that there are 6 `pets` containers in the cluster. These will be scheduled evenly across the Swarm members.

We are going to use the `docker service ps pets` command. If you do this quick fast enough after using the  `--replicas` option you can see the containers come up in real time.

```
$ docker service ps pets
ID            NAME    IMAGE                  NODE   DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE          ERROR  PORTS
7k0flfh2wpt1  pets.1  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node1  Running        Running 9 minutes ago
wol6bzq7xf0v  pets.2  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node3  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
id50tzzk1qbm  pets.3  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node2  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
ozj2itmio16q  pets.4  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node3  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
o4rk5aiely2o  pets.5  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node2  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
35t0eamu0rue  pets.6  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node2  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
44s8d59vr4a8  pets.7  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node1  Running        Running 2 minutes ago
```

Notice that there are now 6 containers listed. It may take a few seconds for the new containers in the service to all show as **RUNNING**.  The `NODE` column tells us on which node a container is running.

Go back to the service web page `http://<node1 IP address>:5000/` and click serve another pet. Notice how each request is being served by a different container. That's Swarm's built-in load balancer routing your request to one of the 6 replicas you just stood up. 

Now point your browser at `http://<node2 IP address>:5000/` and then `http://<node3 IP address:5000/`

Notice how regardless of which IP you used, Swarm could still serve up  your web app. Every node in the Swarm knows how to find any service running on any of the nodes. 

Scale the service back down just five containers again with the `docker service update --replicas1 pets` command. 

```
$ docker service update --replicas 1 pets
```

Verify that the number of containers has been reduced to 1 using the `docker service ps pets` command.

```
$ docker service ps pets
ID            NAME    IMAGE                  NODE   DESIRED STATE  CURRENT STATE           ERROR  PORTS
7k0flfh2wpt1  pets.1  chrch/docker-pets:1.0  node1  Running        Running 13 minutes ago
```
Go ahead and revisit the web page using each of the your 3 nodes IP addresses. Since there is only one replica, there is actually only one node that can serve your web page, but as mentioned before, you can use the IP address of any node in the cluster to get to service - swarm will route your request appropriately. 

Ok - let's scale the service back up one last time:

```
$ docker service update --replicas 3 pets
```

Use `docker service ps pets` to ensure you have 3 replicas running

```
$ docker service ps pets
ID                  NAME                IMAGE                   NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE            ERROR               PORTS
kgki2xjos8ae        pets.1              chrch/docker-pets:1.0   ip-172-31-59-196    Running             Starting 6 seconds ago
lzoaz57txwhn        pets.2              chrch/docker-pets:1.0   ip-172-31-60-146    Running             Starting 6 seconds ago
r1dq2luwwub6        pets.5              chrch/docker-pets:1.0   ip-172-31-60-206    Running             Running 10 minutes ago
```

You have successfully scaled a swarm service up and down.

## <a name="recover-application"></a>Section 5 - Drain a node and reschedule the containers

Your pets app has been doing amazing after hitting Reddit and HN. It's now number 1 on the Apple Store! You have scaled up during the holidays and down during the slow season. Now you are doing maintenance on one of your servers so you will need to gracefully take a server out of the swarm without interrupting service to your customers.


Take a look at the status of your nodes again by running `docker node ls` on **node1**.  

```
$ docker node ls
ID                           HOSTNAME  STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
6dlewb50pj2y66q4zi3egnwbi *  node1   Ready   Active        Leader
ym6sdzrcm08s6ohqmjx9mk3dv    node3   Ready   Active
yu3hbegvwsdpy9esh9t2lr431    node2   Ready   Active
```

You will be taking **node2** out of service for maintenance.

If you haven't already done so, please SSH in to **node2**.

```
$ ssh docker@<node2 IP address>
```

Then lets see the containers that you have running there.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                        PORTS               NAMES
e09ef58ecad8        chrch/docker-pets:1.0   "/bin/sh -c 'pytho..."   About a minute ago   Up About a minute (healthy)                       pets.1.kgki2xjos8ae7niwpnnsrstu9
```

You can see that we have one of the petse containers running here (your output might look different though).

Take a note of the red host name in the prompt it should look something like `[ip-172-31-59-196]`

Now lets jump back to **node1** (the Swarm manager) and take **node2** out of service. To do that, lets run `docker node ls` again.

```
$ docker node ls
ID                           HOSTNAME          STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
e89w8xqkzsnucfdstkpwr1wxi    ip-172-31-59-196  Ready   Active
jke36pkdd2c8gj9c83du8o7wi    ip-172-31-60-206  Ready   Active
kwu7nh9vn02l46uh0py8fytnl *  ip-172-31-60-146  Ready   Active        Leader
```

We are going to take the **ID** for **node2** (match that red host name you took note of to the output you got from `docker node ls` to find the appropriate ID).

Next run `docker node update --availability drain <Node2 ID>` (substituting your container ID). We are using the **node2** host **ID** as input into our `drain` command (not the host name from the previous step). 

```
$ docker node update --availability drain e89w8xqkzsnucfdstkpwr1wxi
```
Check the status of the nodes

```
$ docker node ls
ID                           HOSTNAME          STATUS  AVAILABILITY  MANAGER STATUS
e89w8xqkzsnucfdstkpwr1wxi    ip-172-31-59-196  Ready   Drain
jke36pkdd2c8gj9c83du8o7wi    ip-172-31-60-206  Ready   Active
kwu7nh9vn02l46uh0py8fytnl *  ip-172-31-60-146  Ready   Active        Leader
```

Node **node2** is now in the `Drain` state. 


Switch back to **node2** and see what is running there by running `docker ps`.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

 **node2** does not have any containers running on it.

Lastly, check the service again on **node1** to make sure that the container were rescheduled. You should see all three containers running on the remaining two nodes. Swarm automatically restarted the container on a healthy host when we put **node2** into drain mode. 

```
$ docker service ps pets
ID                  NAME                IMAGE                   NODE                DESIRED STATE       CURRENT STATE            ERROR               PORTS

```

# <a name="cleanup"></a>Cleaning up

Execute the `docker service rm pets` command on **node1** to remove the service called *pets*.

```
$ docker service rm pets
pets
```

Execute the `docker ps` command on **node1** to get a list of running containers.

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
044bea1c2277        ubuntu              "sleep infinity"    17 minutes ago      17 minutes ag                           distracted_mayer
```

You can use the `docker kill <CONTAINER ID>` command on **node1** to kill the sleep container we started at the beginning.

```
$ docker kill 044bea1c2277
```

Finally, lets remove node1, node2, and node3 from the Swarm. We can use the `docker swarm leave --force` command to do that. 

Lets run `docker swarm leave --force` on **node1**.

```
$ docker swarm leave --force
```

Then, run `docker swarm leave --force` on **node2**.

```
$ docker swarm leave --force
```

Finally, run `docker swarm leave --force` on **node3**.

```
$ docker swarm leave --force
```

Congratulations! You've completed this lab. You now know how to build a swarm, deploy applications as collections of services, and scale individual services up and down. Feel free to try any of the other labs.
